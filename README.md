## MASTERING PHP: OOP & DESIGN PATTERNS  

Master **PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Design Patterns** with this structured guide. Learn to write **scalable, maintainable, and efficient** PHP applications using best practices and real-world implementations.  

---

### PHP OOP ESSENTIALS  
- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance & Polymorphism  
- Encapsulation & Abstraction  

---

### CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS  
- **Singleton** – Ensures a class has only one instance.  
- **Factory** – Centralizes object creation for flexibility.  
- **Abstract Factory** – Produces related object families.  
- **Builder** – Step-by-step object creation.  
- **Prototype** – Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones.  

---

### STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS  
- **Adapter** – Connects incompatible interfaces.  
- **Decorator** – Dynamically adds behavior to objects.  
- **Facade** – Simplifies complex system interactions.  
- **Proxy** – Controls object access for efficiency/security.  
- **Composite** – Manages tree structures and hierarchies.  

---

### BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERNS  
- **Observer** – Enables event-driven programming.  
- **Strategy** – Switches algorithms dynamically.  
- **Command** – Encapsulates actions as objects.  
- **State** – Modifies behavior based on state.  
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Delegates tasks through a chain.  

---

### WHY USE DESIGN PATTERNS?  
- Improves Code Reusability & Maintainability  
- Follows SOLID Principles for Scalable Applications  
- Decouples Components for Better Flexibility  
- Enhances Readability & Collaboration  

---

### BEST PRACTICES COVERED  
- Writing Clean & Reusable Code  
- Applying SOLID Principles for better architecture  
- Using Dependency Injection to reduce tight coupling  
- Implementing Unit Testing for reliability
