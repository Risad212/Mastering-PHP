# Mastering PHP  

## Overview  
The **Mastering PHP** repository explores **basic to advanced PHP OOP design patterns**, providing a structured approach to writing **scalable, maintainable, and efficient code**. It covers fundamental OOP principles, best practices, and real-world implementations of design patterns.  

## Key Topics  

### PHP OOP Basics  
- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Encapsulation & Abstraction  

### Creational Design Patterns  
- **Singleton** – Ensures a class has only one instance.  
- **Factory** – Provides a way to create objects without specifying exact classes.  
- **Abstract Factory** – Creates families of related objects.  
- **Builder** – Constructs complex objects step by step.  
- **Prototype** – Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones.  

### Structural Design Patterns  
- **Adapter** – Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.  
- **Decorator** – Dynamically adds new functionality to objects.  
- **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.  
- **Proxy** – Controls access to an object for efficiency and security.  
- **Composite** – Organizes objects into tree structures for hierarchies.  

### Behavioral Design Patterns  
- **Observer** – Defines a dependency between objects for notifications.  
- **Strategy** – Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.  
- **Command** – Encapsulates requests as objects.  
- **State** – Changes object behavior based on its state.  
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Passes requests along a chain of handlers.  

### Best Practices  
- Writing **clean and reusable code**  
- Applying **SOLID principles** for better software design  
- Using **Dependency Injection** for decoupling  
- Implementing **Unit Testing** for code reliability
