🚀 MASTERING PHP: OOP & DESIGN PATTERNS  

Master **PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Design Patterns** with this structured guide. Learn to write **scalable, maintainable, and efficient** PHP applications using best practices and real-world implementations.  

-----------------------------------------------------------
📌 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN  
-----------------------------------------------------------

🔹 PHP OOP Essentials  
✅ Classes & Objects  
✅ Inheritance & Polymorphism  
✅ Encapsulation & Abstraction  

🔹 Creational Patterns 🏗️ *(Creating Objects Efficiently)*  
- Singleton – Ensures a class has only one instance.  
- Factory – Centralizes object creation for flexibility.  
- Abstract Factory – Produces related object families.  
- Builder – Step-by-step object creation.  
- Prototype – Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones.  

🔹 Structural Patterns 🏛️ *(Optimizing Code Structure)*  
- Adapter – Connects incompatible interfaces.  
- Decorator – Dynamically adds behavior to objects.  
- Facade – Simplifies complex system interactions.  
- Proxy – Controls object access for efficiency/security.  
- Composite – Manages tree structures and hierarchies.  

🔹 Behavioral Patterns 🤖 *(Enhancing Object Interactions)*  
- Observer – Enables event-driven programming.  
- Strategy – Switches algorithms dynamically.  
- Command – Encapsulates actions as objects.  
- State – Modifies behavior based on state.  
- Chain of Responsibility – Delegates tasks through a chain.  

-----------------------------------------------------------
🎯 WHY USE DESIGN PATTERNS?  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
✅ Improves Code Reusability & Maintainability  
✅ Follows SOLID Principles for Scalable Applications  
✅ Decouples Components for Better Flexibility  
✅ Enhances Readability & Collaboration  

-----------------------------------------------------------
💡 BEST PRACTICES COVERED  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
- Writing Clean & Reusable Code  
- Applying SOLID Principles for better architecture  
- Using Dependency Injection to reduce tight coupling  
- Implementing Unit Testing for reliability
