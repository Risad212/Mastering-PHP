// ✅ Benefits of Using the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
/*
 * - Reduces tight coupling between high-level modules (ProjectManager) and low-level modules (Developer, Designer, etc.).
 * - Increases flexibility and scalability by allowing new roles without modifying the ProjectManager.
 * - Makes unit testing easier by allowing dependencies to be replaced with mock objects.
 * - Encourages writing reusable and maintainable code.
